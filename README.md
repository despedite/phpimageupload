**A very simple and limited image uploading service, powered by PHP.**
Based on [PHP5's File Upload tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_file_upload.asp), with redirections to the uploaded photo and powered by Bootstrap at the front-end. There's some work to do to get it to a presentable state, so send a pull request if you got any changes to make!

#### To-do
* Check if an image exists and change the image name accordingly (right now it replaces the old image)
* More descriptive error messages
* Bootstrap Alerts on error encountered
* Proper support for mobile
* Drag & Drop?

#### Install
Add to your existing website, and replace the line on upload.php that says "INSERT-WEBSITE-LINK-HERE" to your site's path.
